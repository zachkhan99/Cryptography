GOAL:   The goal of this program is to encode and decode messages from the user.
        Utilizes while loops, mulitple functions, and for loops with parameters.

INPUT:  0, 1, or 2
        text to be encoded
        code to be decyphered
OUTPUT: user menu
        diferent responses to the user's choice from the menu
        encoded message
        decyphered message

defining main() function:
    INPUT:  text to be encoded
            code to be decyphered
    OUTPUT: different responses to the user:
            thanks for doing secret spy stuff with me
            I don't know what you want to do

    STEPS:  1) make a while loop
            2) have keepGoing = True
            3) have the program run the menu() function
            3) have an if statement where if the user inputs a 1,
                the program will ask for the user to input text to
                be encoded
            4) have the program run the encode(plain) function
            5) have an elif statement where if the user inputs
                a 2, the program will ask for the user to input
                text to be decoded
            6) have the program run the decode(coded) function
            7) have an elif statement where if the user inputs
                a 0, the program will output the response a response
                and end the function
            8) have an else statement where if the user inputs anything
                but 1, 2, or 0, the program will respond "i don't know
                what you want me to do

defining menu() function:
    INPUT:  0, 1 or 2
    OUTPUT: the program prints a menu with a title and options

    STEPS:  1) print the title and options
            2) ask the user to input a response
            3) end the function and return the user's input to the main() function

defining encode(plain) function:
    INPUT: the user's plain text
    OUTPUT: the encoded message

    STEPS:  1) make a blank string to represent the new encoded string
            2) make a for loop
            3) make a variable, x, to represent the user's plain text in all caps
            4) make a nested for loop
            5) make a different variable, y, represent a letter in alpha
            6) make this nested for loop conditional so that if the letter from the user's
                plain text, x,compares to the same letter, y, in alpha, it will find the
                same position of alpha in key.
            7) add this letter to the encoded string until all characters are encoded
            8) end the function and return this encoded string to the main function

defining decode(coded) function:
    INPUT: user's encoded message
    OUTPUT: the decoded message

    STEPS:  1) make a blank string to represent the new decoded string
            2) make a for loop
            3) make a variable, x, to represent the user's coded text in all caps
            4) make a nested for loop
            5) make a different variable, y, represent a letter in alpha
            6) make this nested for loop conditional so that if the letter from the user's
                coded text, x,compares to the same letter, y, in alpha, it will find the
                same position of alpha in key.
            7) add this letter to the decoded string until all characters are decoded
            8) end the function and return this decoded string to the main function
